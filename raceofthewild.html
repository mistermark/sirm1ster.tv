            <p>On May 29th <strong><i>sirM1ster</i></strong> and <strong><i>TheRealSeiferoth</i></strong> are going head-to-head in a race dubbed <strong>&ldquo;The Gentlemen's Race of the Wild&rdquo;</strong>. We're celebrating a couple of coincidences: we both started streaming on the same day AND we both played the same game on our first ever stream (before either of us even met each other). So we decided to celebrate our joint Twitch anniversary by challenging each other at the game that started it all... <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>.</p>
            <p>
